# mittwald_container_image (Data Source)

A data source that queries metadata for a given container image.

This data source should typically be used in conjunction with the `mittwald_container_stack` resource to select the default values for the `command` and `entrypoint` attributes.

The respective attributes (like `entrypoint` and `command`) will be populated directly from the latest published image manifest. When the image is hosted in a private registry, you must provide the `registry_id` or `project_id` attribute to access the image.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "mittwald_container_image" "nginx" {
  image = "nginx:1.28.0"
}

resource "mittwald_container_stack" "nginx" {
  project_id    = mittwald_project.test.id
  default_stack = true

  containers = {
    nginx = {
      description = "Example web server"
      image       = data.mittwald_container_image.nginx.image
      entrypoint  = data.mittwald_container_image.nginx.entrypoint
      command     = data.mittwald_container_image.nginx.command

      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `image` (String) The image to use for the container. Follows the usual Docker image format, e.g. `nginx:latest` or `registry.example.com/my-image:latest`. You _can_ omit the tag, in which case `latest` will be used. This will trigger a warning, however.

### Optional

- `project_id` (String) The ID of the project where the image is stored. This attribute (or `registry_id`)  is required if the image is not public.
- `registry_id` (String) The ID of the registry where the image is stored. This attribute (or `project_id`) is required if the image is not public.

### Read-Only

- `command` (List of String) The command to run in the container.
- `entrypoint` (List of String) The entrypoint to run in the container.
