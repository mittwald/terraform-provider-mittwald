### Required

- `article_id` (String) The article ID associated with the AI support. This may be used to change the pricing plan to a higher tier at any time. When changing to a lower tier, the change will only become active after the contract duration (this may result in undefined behavior in the Terraform plan).

- `customer_id` (String) ID of the customer for which AI support should be enabled
- `use_free_trial` (Boolean, [Write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/ephemeral#write-only-arguments)) Use a free trial period for AI support, when available. Only applicable on creation, not on updates.

### Read-Only
