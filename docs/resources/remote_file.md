# mittwald_remote_file (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and manage files on a remote server via SSH.

You can specify either a container_id or an app_id to determine which server to connect to. The SSH hostname is dynamically determined from the project that the app or container belongs to, and the SSH username defaults to the currently authenticated user if not specified.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mittwald_remote_file" "example" {
  container_id = "<container-id>" # either container_id or app_id
  stack_id     = "<stack-id>"     # required when container_id is specified
  # app_id = "<app-id>"            # either container_id or app_id

  # Optional: SSH username (defaults to "<email>@<container-short-id>" if omitted)
  # ssh_user = "ssh-XXXXX"
  # ssh_private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")

  path     = "/path/to/file.txt"
  contents = "This is the content of the file"

  # Alternatively, you can use the file function to read content from a local file
  # contents = file("${path.module}/local_file.txt")

  # Alternatively, use the contents_from_url attribute to fetch content from a URL
  # contents_from_url = "https://example.com/file.txt"
}
```

- `container_id` (String) The ID of the container to connect to. Either container_id+stack_id or app_id must be specified.
- `contents` (String) The contents of the file; use the file function to read from a file on the local filesystem.
- `contents_from_url` (String) The URL to fetch the contents of the file from. If specified and contents is not set, the file will be fetched from this URL.
- `ssh_private_key` (String) The SSH private key to use for the connection. If not specified, it will default to the contents ~/.ssh/id_rsa; use the file function to specify a file path instead.
