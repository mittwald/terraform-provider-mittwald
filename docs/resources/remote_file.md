# mittwald_remote_file (Resource)

This resource allows you to create and manage files on a remote server via SSH.

You can specify either a container_id or an app_id to determine which server to connect to. The SSH hostname is dynamically determined from the project that the app or container belongs to, and the SSH username defaults to the currently authenticated user if not specified.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "mittwald_remote_file" "example" {
  container_id = "<container-id>" # either container_id or app_id
  # app_id = "<app-id>"            # either container_id or app_id

  # Optional: SSH username (defaults to "<email>@<container-short-id>" if omitted)
  # ssh_user = "ssh-XXXXX"

  path     = "/path/to/file.txt"
  contents = "This is the content of the file"

  # Alternatively, you can use the file function to read content from a local file
  # contents = file("${path.module}/local_file.txt")
}
```
