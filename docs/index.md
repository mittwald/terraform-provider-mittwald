# mittwald Provider

This provider allows you to manage mittwald [mStudio resources](https://studio.mittwald.de) using Terraform.

## Getting started & example usage

Register the provider using the following configuration:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mittwald = {
      source = "mittwald/mittwald"
      version = ">= 1.0.0, < 2.0.0"
    }
  }
}

variable "mittwald_api_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "mittwald" {
  # NOTE: You can also use the environment variable MITTWALD_API_TOKEN, instead.
  # In this case, you don't need to specify the api_key variable.
  api_key = var.mittwald_api_key
}
```

In this case, you need to provider your mittwald API key as a terraform variable. Alternatively, you can use the `MITTWALD_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for the mittwald API; if omitted, the `MITTWALD_API_TOKEN` environment variable will be used.
- `debug_request_bodies` (Boolean) Whether to log request bodies when debugging is enabled. CAUTION: This will log sensitive data such as passwords in plain text!
- `endpoint` (String) API endpoint for the mittwald API. Default to `https://api.mittwald.de/v2` if omitted. During regular usage, you probably won't need this. However, it can be useful for testing against a different API endpoint.
