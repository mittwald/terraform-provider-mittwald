# mittwald Provider

The mittwald provider is used to manage mittwald mStudio resources.

## Example Usage & Getting started

Start by configuring the provider in your `required_providers` section:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    mittwald = {
      source  = "mittwald/mittwald"
      version = ">= 1.0.0, <2.0.0"
    }
  }
}

variable "mittwald_api_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

provider "mittwald" {
  # NOTE: You can also use the environment variable MITTWALD_API_TOKEN, instead.
  # In this case, you don't need to specify the api_key variable.
  api_key = var.mittwald_api_key
}
```

You will need an API key to authenticate with the mStudio API. Have a look at the [mStudio developer documentation](https://developer.mittwald.de/docs/v2/api/intro/) to learn how to obtain one.

You can provide the API token either as a Terraform variable, or by setting the `MITTWALD_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for the mittwald API; if omitted, the `MITTWALD_API_TOKEN` environment variable will be used.
- `debug_request_bodies` (Boolean) Whether to log request bodies when debugging is enabled. CAUTION: This will log sensitive data such as passwords in plain text!
- `endpoint` (String) API endpoint for the mittwald API. Default to `https://api.mittwald.de/v2` if omitted. During regular usage, you probably won't need this. However, it can be useful for testing against a different API endpoint.
